<!-- Use jQuery to select each element and apply a different event.
These may include click, double-click, hover, or keypress. Each interaction should result in a visible change on the page, such as changing the text, hiding the element, or changing its style.
You may use inline styles or create your own CSS class to apply changes.-->
